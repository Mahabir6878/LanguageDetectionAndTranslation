**Extracting Text from Images using OCR**
Extracting text from images is a common task in business operations, particularly in processing invoices and receipts. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is employed to convert images of text into machine-encoded text for extraction and use in text format.

**Language Detection**
Language detection is crucial when dealing with datasets containing text in multiple languages. It's essential for event-driven programs where the output depends on user-provided language input. Detecting the language of user-provided text precedes any further action.

**Language Translation**
Language translation involves converting source sentences from one natural language to another using computerized systems without human assistance.

**Functionalities and Technicalities**
Data Collection: Gather data on popular languages from the web or publicly available datasets.
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features such as URL, domain characteristics, website content, SSL/TLS certificate information, etc.
Model Training: Train machine learning models on the dataset by selecting appropriate model architecture and optimizing hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, typically on a separate test set or through cross-validation.
